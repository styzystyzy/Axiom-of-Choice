# Axiom of Choice
AC is an important axiom in axiomatic set theory and it has a wide range of applications in modern mathematics. In this work, we formalize AC and several of its famous equivalent theorems. These theorems include Tukey's lemma, Hausdorff maximal principle, Maximal principle, Zorn's Lemma and Well-ordering theorem. We prove the equivalence between them in Coq. The work is based on the ``axiomatic set theory'' formal system that we developed.
